### **Project Idea: Bike Store Management System**

#### **Summary of the Idea:**
The Bike Store Management System project aims to develop a comprehensive system for managing data related to customers, bikes, sales, and maintenance. The system will store data in a database, analyze it to extract meaningful insights, and provide a web application or dashboard to present reports and results, helping store owners make informed decisions.

### **Project Objectives:**
1. **Data Management:**
   - Record customer information (e.g., name, email, phone number).
   - Track available bikes for sale with details (e.g., brand, model, price, stock).
   - Log financial transactions (sales) and service requests.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Generate reports on sales performance, such as:
     - Top-selling bikes.
     - Highest-spending customers.
   - Analyze maintenance data to identify common issues and suggest proactive service schedules.

3. **Performance Prediction:**
   - Use AI techniques to predict future sales trends based on past data.
   - Forecast maintenance needs based on customer and bike records.

4. **Integrated System Development:**
   - Create a web application to simplify data access.
   - Provide a dashboard displaying key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue and the number of bikes sold.

### **How the System Works:**
1. **Database Management:**
   - A SQL database is designed to store data in tables for customers, bikes, sales, and services.
   - The database is continuously updated when new sales or bikes are added.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Data is analyzed using Python with libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn.
   - Reports are extracted, such as:
     - Monthly sales percentages.
     - Most frequent customers.
     - Bikes requiring frequent maintenance.

3. **Performance Prediction:**
   - A machine learning model is built to predict customer behavior and future sales trends.
   - Example: Predicting an increase in demand for specific bikes during summer.

4. **Presenting Results:**
   - A web application is created using Flask or Streamlit to display the analysis and predictions.
   - A user-friendly interface provides access to performance reports.

**Explanation of Each Directory/Files**
app/: This is the core of your application.

__init__.py: Initializes your app and configures Flask, SQLAlchemy, MLflow, etc.
models.py: Contains the database models (e.g., Customer, Sale).
forms.py: Contains the Flask-WTF forms (e.g., SalesStaffForm).
routes.py: Contains all the routes for your Flask application.
static/: This folder holds all static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
templates/: Jinja2 templates for rendering HTML pages.
database/: This folder stores your SQLite database or any database-related files. You can also place database migration scripts here.
mlflow_models/: Folder for storing models that are deployed through MLflow. Each version of a model will have its own subfolder.
migrations/: If you use Flask-Migrate to handle database migrations, this folder will contain the migration scripts.
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies for the project. This is the file you’ll use to install all the required libraries.
